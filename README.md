Repeating Backgrounds for Unity
===============================

This is a tiny library that consists of a few C# classes to let you quickly and easily create infinte tiled/repeating backgrounds for 2D Unity projects.

There's three main scripts:

1. GridBackground, which draws an endless grid (great as a placeholder)

2. CheckeredBackground, which is like GridBackground, but instead uses a checker pattern

3. TexturedBackground, which repeats any texture infinitely at a user-specified size

Just move your camera around the world and these scripts will automatically fill the screen with the background and animate it correspondingly.
